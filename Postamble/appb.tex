\section{Cross check between Andrey Kim and Bobby Johnston}

As an additional cross check, Bobby calculated a $DV\pi^0P$ beam spin asymmetry and compared to Andrey Kim's results. This check will not comment on any acceptance, luminosity, or virtual photon flux factor calculations, but does validate exclusive event selection criteria. By examining figure \ref{fig:bsa} we can see that agreement is reasonable, especially considering Bobby's calculation does not have sideband subtraction included.
