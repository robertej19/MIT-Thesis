%% The documentclass options along with the pagestyle can be used to generate

%% re-specify the pagestyle after you \include cover.tex. For more
%% information, see the first few lines of mitthesis.cls.

%% If you want blank pages before new chapters to be labelled ``This
%% Page Intentionally Left Blank'', use the ``leftblank'' option, as
