    \section{Overview}
        \subsection{Introduction}
            The CLAS12 detector is a large angle spectrometer that generally covers angles from 5 to 130 degrees, spanned by two main detector subsystems - the Forward Detector and the Central Detector.

    \section{Target and Other}
        \subsection{Beam from JLab}
                For entry into CLAS12, the beamline specs are as follows:\\
                Beam current: up to 50 nA\\
                Beam energy spread: $10^-4$\\
                Beam size: Less than 0.4 mm\\
                Beam stability: Less than 0.1 mm\\
                Beam halo: $10^-4$\\
                Beam polarization: up to 80\%\\
        \subsection{Liquid Hydrogen Target}
            \indent The hydrogen target in RGA is cooled to 20 K using a He4 evaporation fridge. Can by polarized by dynamic nuclear polarization, driven by a 140 GHz microwave source, can reach 90\% polarization for protons, 40\% for deuterons (both longitudinally polarized). The polarization can be measured by a Q-meter based NMR. 2.5 cm diameter target, extended 5 cm long. \\
            \indent RGA does not use a polarized target. The beam is polarized, but the target is not, so polarization is not helpful for extracting the 5-fold differential cross section (but it would be if the target was also polarized, and is useful for BSA measurements).
        \subsection{Luminosity Measurement}
            Luminosity in CLAS12 is measured from the Faraday Cup and using reference reactions such as elastic scattering. We don't use the Faraday Cup event by event, but we do use it run by run. For beam current measurements, beam position monitors upstream are used - but this is for monitoring on-line, not for analysis.
        \subsection{Moller Polarimeters}
            As stated, for RGA, the fact that the beam is polarized is not useful, but it is true and is measured by Moller Polarimeters.

        \subsection{Trigger}
            CLAS12 runs with "open trigger", which means different sub-experiments can define their own triggering logic. There is a standard electron trigger, based off of hits in HTCC, ECal, and FTOF. 
  

        
        \subsection{Faraday Cup}
            Can manage 175 Watts - 17 nA at 10 GeV. Is used to calibrate beam current, needs a blocker in at higher currents.
            
    \section{Central Detector}
        Overview: The Central Detector spans roughly 35 to 125 degrees, and contains 4 sub-detectors, all in a 5 Tesla solenoidal field. The 5 detectors are: SVT, MMVT, CTOF, and CND. 
        \subsection{SVT}
            The Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT) covers from 35 to 125 degrees in $\theta$. Has 8 layers (4 concentric rings) with 10, 14, 18, and 24 sectors respectively, double sided. 2$\pi$ angular coverage. Read out with ASICs- FSSR2s. Designed to operate at $10^{35}$ luminosity, momentum resolution of $\sim$ 5\% for 1 GeV particles with $\theta$ = 90 degrees. 42 cm long, 4 cm wide, 0.4 cm thick. Spatial resolution of 50 $\mu$m, momentum resolution $\sim$ 5\%, theta resolution 10 mrad, phi resolution 5 mrad.  33,792 total readout channels. Sensor thickness is 320 $\mu$m, readout pitch 156 $\mu$ m.Supported by rohacell and carbon fiber backing to reduce material budget, at $\sim 1\%$ of a radiation length.

		\subsection{MMVT}
		    Composed of two parts: a \textbf{Barrel Tracker} and a \textbf{Forward Tracker}. PCB is 200 $\mu$m thick, 0.3\% of a radiation length. 20 MHz sampling frequency. Time resolution of 10 ns. 500 $\mu$m strip pitch.\\
		    \textbf{Advantages of MMVT for CLAS12 :} \\
		    Price: much cheaper compared to SVT. For large area, the price become rapidly prohibitive.
		    Material: Since it is a gasesous detector, it is good for the material budget.
		    Physics Requirements: Not as good spatial resolution as SVT, but can resolve polar angle better. Optimal perform ace is actually achieved with a combination of both detectors are used.

        \subsection{Torus}
            6 coil torus, 4k amps, 3.5 Tesla torodial field, supercritical LHe cooled. 14.2 Megajoules stored energy. 2 Henries of inductance. Field strongest at small angles, weakest at large angles. 
              Inbending vs out bending:
        I have been wondering about this as well. All I know is that inbending and outbending have different acceptances.
        So, I guess some channels prefers inbending while the others do outbending? I’m not sure though. FX claims outbending results have better quality for these days.

        \subsection{Drift Chambers}
            There are 3 layers of drift chambers, each with 6 sections. Each chamber has 2 superlayers of 6 layers by 112 wires, for a total of 24,192 wires. (Structure is 112 wires * 6 layers * 2 superlayers * 18 DC sections = 24,192 wires). Physical wire sectioning looks like:\\
            (IIIIII)-(IIIIII)---(IIIIII)-(IIIIII)---(IIIIII)-(IIIIII) x 6 sectors\\
            Where each "I" is a layer of 112 wires.\\

Read out by 64 channel photomultipliers. $\beta_{min}$=0.95, $\gamma_{min}$ = 3.3
            
            What is angular resolution?
            
            Reminder of relevant equation:
            \begin{equation}
                \cos{\theta} = \frac{1}{\beta n} \longrightarrow \theta = \arccos{\frac{1}{\beta n}}
            \end{equation}
            
            \begin{equation}
                \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}} \longrightarrow \beta = 1-\frac{1}{1-\gamma^2} 
            \end{equation}

            The timing resolution minimums are for being close to the beam axis where particles are moving faster, and farther out from the beamline (larger theta) particles are moving slower so a less resolved time difference is acceptable.

            FTOF two panels:
Official answer from CLAS12 FTOF NIM paper:
"For tracks that pass through both arrays the combined time information (described in Ref. [10]) is used and results in a 20% improvement compared to using the hit information from panel-1b alone.”, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900220302102

I guess this is the right answer though:
1a is recycled one from CLAS while 1b is new one.
            
            
        \subsection{PCal and ECal}
            ECal from CLAs could only contain showers with E < 5 GeV. Above 5.5 GeV, couldn't resolve neutral pion gamma gamma angle, so needed PCAL. PCAL is 7 meters from target, ECAL is 7.5 M from target. EC segmentation 10 cm, PCAL finer segmentation. PCal 5.5 radiation lengths. 20.5 radiation lengths total. Both are sampling calorimeters, with PB and scintillator layers. The CLAS ECAL was resused and a new PCAL was installed in front of it. Primarily used for identification of electrons, photons, gamma gamma decays from pions, and neutrons. They are sampling calorimeters with six moduels. Each module has a triangular shape with 54 (15/15/24 - PCAL/ECALinner/ECALouter) layers of 1 cm htick scintillators segmented into 4.5/10 cm (PCAL/ECAL) wide strips and sandwiched between 2.2 mm thick lead sheets. The total thickness is about 20.5 radiation lengths. \\
            \indent Scintillator layers are grouped into three readout views with 5/5/8 PCAL/ECinner/ECouter, layers per view providing several cm resolution of energy clusters. Light from each scintillator readout group is routed to PMTs via flexible optical fibers.\\
            Overall perfomance:\\
            Energy resolution of 10\%, position resolution of 2 cm, time resolution of 500 ps. \\
            Are these the real statistics? Because they seem like BS.

Only about 50\% of the electron triggers recorded with an inbending torus polarity are actually electrons. For outbending torus polarity, hte electron trigger purity is as high at 70\%.

Outbending allows for lower Q2 measurements, inbending allows for slighly higher Q2 measurements.
