The careful analysis of the experimental data will allow for the calculation of the number of events observed in a specific region of phase space, which combined with the luminosity determined from beam charge accumulated on the Faraday cup provides a rudimentary estimate of the differential \xsec. However, many corrections need to be applied to this raw calculation to arrive at a more accurate result. The most dominant correction term is known as ``acceptance'' which can be thought of the ratio of the number of events that are experimentally detected relative to the number that truly occurred. In this work we will use ``acceptance'' to refer to a combination of geometrical acceptance (the fraction of 4$\pi$ surface area covered by the detector systems), detector efficiency, and track reconstruction efficiency. This correction term (and others) are best estimated by creating a simulation of the physics experiment with computational means, and using the ratio of the number of detected simulated events to the number of generated simulated events as an approximation to the true acceptance, \eqref{eq:acceptance}. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:acceptance}
    \epsilon_{acc} = \frac{N_{detected,experiment}}{N_{truth}} \approx  \frac{N_{detected,simulation}}{N_{truth,simulation}}  \equiv \frac{N_{sim}}{N_{gen}} = \hat{\epsilon}_{acc}.
\end{equation}

Here $\hat{\epsilon}_{acc}$ is the estimator for the true acceptance, $\epsilon_{acc}$. For the remainder of this work, we will refer to the number of events detected in the real-world experiment as \Nexp, those produced in the real-world as \Ntruth, those detected in the simulation as \Nsim, and those generated for simulation as \Ngen.  

Several components are necessary to arrive at a computational estimate of $\epsilon_{acc}$ and other correction factors. They are: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item A model of the true underlying physics processes to produce \Ngen \secref{sec:ch3generator}
    \item A method to simulate the experiment to produce \Nsim \secref{sec:sim_pipeline}
    \item Sufficient computational infrastructure to perform the calculations \secref{sec:comp_infrastructure}
\end{itemize}



\iffalse
Approaching through the lens of an inverse problem, we use existing knowledge to create event generators that produce reasonable the underlying physics processes. These computer generated datasets are then swam through microphysics simulations of the CLAS12 experiment on an event by event basis to produce a simulated dataset. By comparing the experimental data to the simulated data, and the simulated data to the model of the underlying distribution, inferences can be made about the true underlying distribution generating the experimental data.
