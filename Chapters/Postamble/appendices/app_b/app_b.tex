\chapter{BSA Cross Check}


The $DV\pi^0P$ beam spin asymmetry was calculated and compared to collaboration approved results. This check will not comment on any acceptance, luminosity, or virtual photon flux factor calculations, but does validate exclusive event selection criteria. By examining figure \ref{fig:bsa} we can see that agreement is reasonable, especially considering this work's BSA calculation does not have sideband subtraction included.

Fig \ref{fig:bsa} shows an overlay comparison of collaboration results (black datapoints, red fit line) and this work's results (red datapoints, orange fit line).
