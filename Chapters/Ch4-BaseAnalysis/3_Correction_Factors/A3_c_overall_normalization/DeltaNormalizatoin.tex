Intrinstic dipole moment of the proton and neutron, comes from the fact that they are made of quarks. There is also orbital motion of the proton.

            
    \section{The Delta States}
            What are the 4 delta states?
            Delta electric quadrupole memonet? Yes - -0.043 efm2 and magnetic octupole moment of -0.0035 efm3 for Delta+
            
            Importantly, the delta states have a mass of about 1232 MeV. The energy difference from this to a proton, about 300 MeV, is important as it represents the energy needed to flip a quark, this is called the \textbf{color hyperfine interaction}. Moreover, we can compare the energy levels of positronium and charmonium, (or any other quarkonium) and we see that there is a very similar energy level structure, but about a factor of a million difference in the magnitude of the energy level splittings.
