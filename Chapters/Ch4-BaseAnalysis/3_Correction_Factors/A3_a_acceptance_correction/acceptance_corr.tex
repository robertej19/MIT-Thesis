The acceptance correction, in each kinematic bin, was simply calculated as $\frac{N_{rec}}{N_{gen}}$, where $N_{gen}$ is the number of events produced by the generator in a specific bin, and $N_{rec}$ is the number of events in that bin that were reconstructed and identified as a $DV\pi^0P$ event by exclusivity cuts. 

Low acceptance bins (less than 5\%) were excluded from further study, following from the CLAS6 analysis procedure.
