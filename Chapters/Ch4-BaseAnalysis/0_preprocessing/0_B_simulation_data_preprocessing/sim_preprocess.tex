%\subsubsection{Simulation:Experiment Resolution Matching}

The detector responses in the GEMC system were modeled to perform slightly better than their real-world counterparts. This means the signal data from the simulations are cleaner than the real experiment, and so smearing factors must be added to provide a better match. This convention was chosen because the alternative (with simulations performing worse than real-world detectors) would yield data that is difficult to deconvolve. \figref{fig:bad} shows the discrepancy between the experimental and simulated data sets, for various variable combinations.

To improve the matching between simulation and experiment, Gaussian smearing factors were added after reconstruction to the simulated dataset. These factors were tuned by S. Lee \parencite{Lee2022MeasurementDetector} to have optimal matching across all missing mass spectra combinations \figref{fig:good}. In particular, the outgoing proton and photon momenta were smeared with Gaussian kernels with standard deviations $\sigma$ determined as function of momenta and dependent on particle location (CD, FD, or FT).
