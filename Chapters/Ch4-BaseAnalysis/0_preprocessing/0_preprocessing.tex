In a perfect world, experimental and simulated data could be immediately utilized to compute cross-sections once obtained. In reality, a variety of factors - such as defects in experimental detectors or issues in modeling real-world physics - necessitate minor adjustments to be made to the datasets. It is of course not feasible to re-run entire experiments just to address these small issues, and instead is best handled by pre-processing the data with well-motivated correcting factors.  In particular, the experimental data requires fiducial cuts corresponding to detector dead-zones or otherwise problematic areas, as well as energy loss corrections due to underestimates in the reconstruction scheme. The simulated datasets require smearing factors to more closely resemble the real-world detector and reconstruction algorithm performances.
