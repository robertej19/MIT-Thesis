\subsection{Acceptance Correction}
The largest correction factor in this work is the acceptance correction, which is a convolution of detector efficiency, geometrical acceptance, reconstruction efficiency, and PID and event cuts. We defined acceptance in \eqref{eq:acceptance} as

    \begin{equation*}
      \recallLabel{eq:acceptance},
    \end{equation*}

where we utilize simulations to arrive at an estimator for the acceptance, $\hat{\epsilon}$. The correction term is calculated bin-by-bin, procedurally illustrated in \figref{fig:acccorr}. $\hat{\epsilon}$ values for this analysis were typically on the 1-10\% level. Low acceptance bins were excluded at a threshold of below 0.5\%. The distribution of acceptance correction factors is shown in \figref{fig:acccorrdist}.

\subsection{Other Corrections}

    \subsubsection*{Radiative Corrections}

    Radiative corrections were estimated using simulations as described in Chapter 3. In particular, the ratio of the acceptance correction between using radiative and non-radiative generated events was taken. Sample results are shown in \figref{fig:radcorr}.

\end{figure}

    \subsubsection*{Reconstruction Efficiency}

    Similar to radiative corrections, uncertainties in reconstruction were estimated by running simulations at different levels of current background merging (40nA, 45nA, and 55nA) and compared to the nomianl 50nA datafiles. Differences were taken as a measure of systematic uncertainty. 

    \subsection*{Momentum Corrections, Smearing, and Exclusivity Cut Uncertainties}
    Uncertainties were generated for momentum corrections, smearing factors, and event selection by altering the momentum corrections and smearing factors by \pm 10\% and rerunning the analysis, and for exclusivity cuts by changing the thresholds to 2$\sigma$ (narrow) and 4$\sigma$ (wide). The differences in the resulting cross section values were taken as an estimate of uncertainty. 
        
    \subsubsection*{Overall Normalization}

    Absolute normalization remains an ongoing effort by dedicated working groups in the CLAS collaboration. At present, we can compare the CLAS12 data to the published CLAS6 result, which contains a large number of overlapping kinematic bins. By adjusting the virtual photon flux factor and epsilon terms for the higher beam energy, we can obtain a direct comparison between the work of \parencite{Bedlinskiy2014ExclusiveCLAS} and our efforts.Published values for the reduced cross sections from the CLAS6 experiment for the DV$\pi^0$P channel are available \href{https://journals.aps.org/prc/supplemental/10.1103/PhysRevC.90.025205}{here}. Overall, there is not a large systematic shift in either direction between the CLAS12 and CLAS6 values (observe \ref{fig:combined_t0.2}-\ref{fig:combined_t1.5}). Instead, we take the difference between the two sets of data points as a measure of systematic uncertainty. This uncertainty will be removed once the current absolute normalization is validated. 

    

    \iffalse
    No systematic shift observed between clas6 and clas12 results, although the bins had a descrpancy that is for now included as an error untilt he absolute normazliation is better undersoot by the collaboration. The pictures only show some of it. 

    The accepted results from the CLAS6 experiment  can be used as a cross check for this work.

    FINIT BIN

    The advantage of finer binning is to provide improved density estimation. The
acceptance corrections and the finite bin width effects should increase with the bin
size. However, the bin size cannot be narrower than the effective resolutions in the
binning variables to minimize bin migration. Extremely small bins would not have
any statistical significance in each bin, which would lead to an invalid analysis. It is
important to determine the optimal binning.nm566+[
