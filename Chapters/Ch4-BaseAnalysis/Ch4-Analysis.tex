We now recall below the expression for the experimental cross section, \eqref{eq:DVPiPCrossSection_exp}

The experimental data as described in \chref{Chapter:Experiment} provides access to $N(Q^2,x_B,t,\phi_{\pi})$ and \Lumiint, while the data simulated as described in \chref{Chapter:Simulations} allows determination of the correction factors. The specific steps for calculating these terms that are explained in this chapter are: 


\begin{itemize}
  \item Correct for experimental and simulation deficiencies in pre-processing \secref{sec:Ch4_data_preprocess}
  \item Select \dvpip events from experimental and simulated data \secref{sec:Ch4_event_selection}
  \item Determine integrated luminosity from accumulated beam charge \secref{sec:luminosity}
  \item Partition data into kinematic bins \secref{sec:Ch4_binning}
  \item Apply correction factors and calculate uncertainties \secref{sec:Ch4_corr_factors}
\end{itemize}

Cross section results are presented in \secref{sec:Ch4_cross_section}. This analysis method\footnote{Analysis repository is found here:  \href{https://github.com/robertej19/clas12DVPiP}{https://github.com/robertej19/clas12DVPiP}}
  yields a binned \xsec with correction factors applied bin-by-bin. This approach is favored for its straightforwardness, but comes at the cost of additional uncertainties. Statistical methods to supplant this are discussed in \secref{Chapter:Ch5_IBU}.

For each kinematic bin the differential cross section can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    \sigma = \frac{N_{meas}}{L \epsilon}\frac{1}{\delta}
\end{equation}

Where $\frac{N_{meas}}{L}$ is the number of events from experiment normalized by the integrated luminosity before acceptance and radiatvie corrections. $\epsilon$ = $\frac{N^{RAD}_{rec}}{{N^{RAD}_{gen}}}$ is the acceptance correction and $\delta$ is the radiative correction.



$\delta$ can be obtained by using the following:

\begin{equation}
    \delta = \frac{N^{RAD}_{gen}}{N^{NORAD}_{gen}}
\end{equation}

$\delta$ and $\epsilon$ need to be properly calculated, but for a first pass we will ignore them so we have just
