\Xsecs are theoretically interpreted as  the probability for a specific interaction to occur. They can be experimentally estimated by measuring the occurrence frequency relative to the total possible interaction opportunities. In general, the \xsec $\sigma$ can be expressed as \eqref{eq:basic_xsec} the number of measured events of interest $N_{meas}$ divided by the number of total interaction opportunities \Lumi. \Lumi is known as luminosity and is a product of only experimental parameters, such as the number of particles present and the experiment duration. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:basic_xsec}
    \sigma = \frac{\counts}{\Lumi}
\end{equation}

Measuring the complete \xsec at once is not feasible, so instead estimates are made of the differential \xsec \eqref{eq:basic_diff_xsec}, which instead evaluates the probability for a specific interaction to occur in a differential region of phase space, $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}$. Infinitesimal measurements are not possible, so events are counted over some small discretized generalized volume \textcolor{purple}{$\Delta \Omega$}. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:basic_diff_xsec}
    \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{ \counts} {\Lumi \textcolor{purple}{\Delta \Omega}}
\end{equation}

In practice, a number of correction terms need to be included to account for differences between experiment and theory. These correction terms, combined with the specifics of this analysis, yield the full experimental expression of the \xsec \eqref{eq:DVPiPCrossSection_exp}. 

     \begin{equation}\labelAndRemember{eq:DVPiPCrossSection_exp}
           { \frac{    d^4\sigma_{  ep \rightarrow ep'\pi^0}   } {dQ^2dx_Bdtd\phi_{\pi}} 
                =   \frac{ \textcolor{red}{ N(Q^2,x_B,t,\phi_{\pi})}} {\Lumiint \textcolor{purple}{ \Delta Q^2 \Delta x_B \Delta t \Delta \phi_{\pi}}} 
                \frac{1}{\textcolor{correctionfactors}{\epsilon_{acc} \delta_{RC} \delta_{Norm} Br(\pi^0\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)}}}
     \end{equation}      \myequations{DV$\pi$P Experimental Cross Section}

The terms on the right-hand side of this equation are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{red}{$N(Q^2,x_B,t,\phi_{\pi})$} - Number of events recorded in a given $Q^2$, $x_B$, $t$, $\phi_{\pi}$ bin.

\item \Lumiint - Integrated luminosity

\item \textcolor{purple}{$\Delta Q^2 \Delta x_B \Delta t \Delta \phi_{\pi}$} - These are the bin sizes or intervals for the variables $Q^2$, $x_B$, $t$, and $\phi_{\pi}$.

\item \textcolor{correctionfactors}{$\epsilon_{acc}$} - Acceptance correction, which is a combination of detector efficiency and geometrical acceptance, determined through simulations. 

\item \textcolor{correctionfactors}{$\delta_{RC}$} - Radiative correction factor

\item \textcolor{correctionfactors}{$\delta_{Norm}$} - Overall normalization factor

\item \textcolor{correctionfactors}{$Br(\pi^0\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)$} - Branching ratio of the decay of a neutral pion ($\pi^0$) into two photons ($\gamma\gamma$), which is most recently measured at 98.8131\%  \cite{Husek2019PreciseDecay}

For each kinematic bin the differential cross section can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    \sigma = \frac{N_{meas}}{L \epsilon}\frac{1}{\delta}
\end{equation}

Where $\frac{N_{meas}}{L}$ is the number of events from experiment normalized by the integrated luminosity before acceptance and radiatvie corrections. $\epsilon$ = $\frac{N^{RAD}_{rec}}{{N^{RAD}_{gen}}}$ is the acceptance correction and $\delta$ is the radiative correction.



$\delta$ can be obtained by using the following:

\begin{equation}
    \delta = \frac{N^{RAD}_{gen}}{N^{NORAD}_{gen}}
\end{equation}

$\delta$ and $\epsilon$ need to be properly calculated, but for a first pass we will ignore them so we have just



We can calculate the luminosity L through the following equation

\begin{equation}
    L = \frac{N_A l \rho Q_{FCUP}}{e}
\end{equation}

Where $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant, l is the length of the target,  $\rho$ is the density of the target (liquid hydrogen), $Q_{FCUP}$ is the charge collected on the Faraday cup, and e is the charge of the electron. The values of these quantities are (ignoring uncertainties on experimental quantities for the time being):\\

$N_A$ = 6.02214 x $10^{23}$\\
l = 5 cm\\
$\rho$ = 0.07 $g/cm^3$\\
e = 1.602 x $10^-19$ Coulombs\\
$Q_{FCUP}$ - this must be measured and obtained from analysis. Typical runs at CLAS12 have an accumulated beam charge of tens to hundreds of thousands of nanoCoulumbs.
