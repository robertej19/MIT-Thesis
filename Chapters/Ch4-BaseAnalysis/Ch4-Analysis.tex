We now recall below the expression for the experimental cross section, \eqref{eq:DVPiPCrossSection_exp}

        \begin{equation*}

        \end{equation*}

The experimental data as described in \chref{Chapter:Experiment} provide access to $N(Q^2,x_B,t,\phi_{\pi})$ and \Lumiint, while the data simulated as described in \chref{Chapter:Simulations} allow determination of the correction factors. The specific steps for calculating these terms that are explained in this chapter are: 


\begin{itemize}
  \item Correct for experimental and simulation deficiencies in pre-processing \secref{sec:Ch4_data_preprocess}
  \item Select \dvpip events from experimental and simulated data \secref{sec:Ch4_event_selection}
  \item Determine integrated luminosity from accumulated beam charge \secref{sec:luminosity}
  \item Partition data into kinematic bins \secref{sec:Ch4_binning}
  \item Apply correction factors and calculate uncertainties \secref{sec:Ch4_corr_factors}
\end{itemize}

Cross sections can then be calculated on a bin-by-bin basis, which is favorable due to its straightforward implementability. On the other hand, it fails to account for (possibly large) systematic biases. Statistical methods to address these issues are discussed in \chref{Chapter:Ch5_IBU}, while cross section results for both methods are shown in \secref{sec:Ch5_raw_results}. \footnote{Analysis repository is found here:  \href{https://github.com/robertej19/clas12DVPiP}{https://github.com/robertej19/clas12DVPiP}}.

For each kinematic bin the differential cross section can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    \sigma = \frac{N_{meas}}{L \epsilon}\frac{1}{\delta}
\end{equation}

Where $\frac{N_{meas}}{L}$ is the number of events from experiment normalized by the integrated luminosity before acceptance and radiatvie corrections. $\epsilon$ = $\frac{N^{RAD}_{rec}}{{N^{RAD}_{gen}}}$ is the acceptance correction and $\delta$ is the radiative correction.



$\delta$ can be obtained by using the following:

\begin{equation}
    \delta = \frac{N^{RAD}_{gen}}{N^{NORAD}_{gen}}
\end{equation}

$\delta$ and $\epsilon$ need to be properly calculated, but for a first pass we will ignore them so we have just
