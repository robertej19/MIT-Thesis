\section{Exploring Structure through Scattering}\label{ch1:sec1:background}

    \subsection{Discovery of the Proton}
        Gieiger Marsden -, low energy scattering
        Yimin has good references for this part of proton discovery
    
    \subsection{Electron as a Precision probe}
        Words about wavelength
        Include discussion of wavelength and momentum transfer (but in practice, limiting factor to resolution is lens system %https://advanced-microscopy.utah.edu/education/electron-micro/%
        
    - neutron discovery (see Sangbaek)
    - pointlike consitutents
    As we increase the resolution (resolve features over smaller spatial distances), what we see is dependent on what resolution scale we are at. An exception to this case is if we are investigating point-like particles, which would have an identical response across all resolution scales

    - development of quark model
    - scaling behavior and asymptotic freedom
    - details about scattering experiments from first principles
    - words about elastic scattering (mott scattering)
    - Plot of elastic form factors, discussion of Ge and Gm, Rosenbluth formula
    - Mention TPEX
    - discussion of inelastic scattering
    - Structure funcitons
    - Discussion of spin and sum rules
    - Proton not a point mass - it has structure
    - proton structure measurements
    - lepton scattering experiments, HERA, etc

%Maybe someone will tell you to include something about the standard model
