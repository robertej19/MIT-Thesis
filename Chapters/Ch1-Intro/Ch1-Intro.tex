Humans have tried to understand the nature of the world around us for millennia, with discerning the structure of matter being a central effort in this quest. Famously, the Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus ($\sim$ 5th century BCE) are credited with the concept of ``atomism'' - the belief that matter is composed of tiny indivisible particles called atoms (from the Greek $\alpha \tau o \mu o \sigma$, roughly translating to ``uncuttable'' \parencite{Taylor1999Commentary}. Even further back, there are Indian records from as early as the 8th century BCE conceptualizing the world as being built from tiny fundamental particles \parencite{McEvilley2002ThePhilosophies}.

Scientific progress on this front stalled until the early 1800s, when chemists explored how different elements combined to form compounds in specific, repeatable, small integer ratios. John Dalton formulated this idea as the Law of Multiple Proportions, which paved the way for early scientific atomic theory \parencite{Britannica2010LawProportions}. In 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered the first subatomic particle, the electron, by studying cathode rays \parencite{Thomson1901OnAtoms}. Accordingly, he devised a model of the atom which had electrons embedded in a ball of positively charged material, called the Thomson, or Plum Pudding, Model\parencite{Navarro1995AThomson}.

With the idea that the atom was a composite object, scientists began experimentation to study its exact structure. This was the start of what has been the 120 years of particle scattering studies to probe first atomic, then nuclear structure. 

The rest of this chapter details the findings of previous scattering experiments and provides a background on Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) and Deeply Virtual Exclusive Processes (DVEP), the topic of this work. Chapter \ref{Chapter:Experiment} describes the experimental configuration of the CLAS12 detector and data taking conditions. Chapter \ref{Chapter:Simulations} discusses the computational resources and frameworks needed for a complete \xsec measurement. The analysis procedure for combining experimental and simulated data into a differential cross section with correction factors is discussed in chapter \ref{Chapter:BaseAnalysis}, with additional statistical methods covered in \ref{Chapter:Ch5_IBU}. Lastly, Chapter \ref{Chapter:Further Analysis} displays and discusses results and uncertainties and reports on further physics analysis, summarizes this work, and lays a path for finalizing the measurement. The appendices include numerous technical details and supplemental plots.
