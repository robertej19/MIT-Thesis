Humans have tried to understand the nature of the world around us for millennia, with discerning the structure of matter being a central effort in this quest. Famously, the Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus ($\sim$ 5th century BCE) are credited with the concept of ``atomism'' - the belief that matter is composed of tiny indivisible particles called atoms (from the Greek $\alpha \tau o \mu o \sigma$, roughly translating to ``uncuttable'' \cite{C.C.W.Taylor1999Commentary}. Even further back, there are Indian records from as early as the 8th century BCE conceptualizing the world as being built from tiny fundamental particles \cite{ThomasMcEvilley2002THePhilosophies}.

Scientific progress on this front stalled until the early 1800s, when chemists explored how different elements combined in to form compounds in specific, repeatable, small integer ratios. John Dalton formulated this idea as the Law of Multiple Proportions, which paved the way for early scientific atomic theory \cite{Britannica2010LawProportions}. In 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered the first subatomic particle, the electron, by studying cathode rays\cite{Thomson1901OnAtoms}. Accordingly, he devised a model of the atom which had electrons embedded in a ball of positively charged material, called the Thomson, or Plum Pudding, Model\cite{JaumeNavarro1995AThomson}.

With the idea that the atom was a composite object, scientist began experimentation to study its exact structure. This was the start of what has been the 120 years of particle scattering studies to probe first atomic, then nuclear structure. 

The rest of this chapter details the findings of previous scattering experiments and provides a background on Generalized Parton Distributions and Deeply Virtual Exclusive Processes, the topic of this work. Chapter 2 describes the experimental setup of the CLAS12 detector and data taking conditions. Chapter 3 discusses data analysis procedures to reconstruct particles and classify events from detector level information. Simulations and computational pipelines for this work are presented in chapter 4. The analysis procedure for combining experimental and simulated data into a differential cross section with correction factors is discussed in chapter 5. Chapter 6 displays and discusses results and uncertainties. Chapter 7 summarizes this work and lays a path for finalizing the measurement. The appendicies include numerous technical details and supplemental plots.

        \subsection{Deviation into Rosenbluth and TPEX}
        
                
            The Rosenbluth method of measuring the ratio of $G_E$ and $G_M$ has awful systematics, based mainly in the facts that you need to measure an absolute cross section, worry about radiative corrections, and measure at low $Q^2$. A better way to measure the proton form factor ratio is by a \textbf{polarization transfer} measurement. This uses a \textbf{Focal Plane Polarimeter} to converst transverse polarization into an azimuthal distribution:
            
                  
            \begin{figure}[H]

                \caption{Olympus experimental setup}
            \end{figure}
            
            This method has the advantages that we are measuring a ratio, not an absolute cross section, so many uncertainties cancel, such as the FPP analyzing power. Olympus produced the following:
            
                  
            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=10cm]{Chapters/Ch1-Intro/Ch1-Sec1-Background/pics/elastic-ep/olympus-form-factors.PNG}
                \caption{$G_E$ and $G_M$ ratio measurements}
            \end{figure}
            
            This discrepancy may be due to two photon exchange, which we can measure by comparing electron to positron scattering:
            
                  
            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=10cm]{Chapters/Ch1-Intro/Ch1-Sec1-Background/pics/elastic-ep/tpex.PNG}
                \caption{Electron Positron charge interference}
            \end{figure}
        
        
            TPEX is a currently proposed experiment to extend this out to farther $Q^2$, which is challenging due to its lower luminosity of elastic scattering as $Q^2$ increases.    

            Alarcon's 2023 study discusses the two-photon exchange experiment TPEX \cite{Alarcon2023Two-PhotonTPEX}.
