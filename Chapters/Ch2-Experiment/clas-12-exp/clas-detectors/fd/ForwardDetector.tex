    \subsubsection{Forward Detector}
        Overview:
        \subsubsection{HTCC}
            Used basically as an electron trigger. Composed of 60 lightweight ellipsoidal mirrors, that focus Cherenkov light onto eigh 5-inch phototubes (48 channels on entire HTCC). Working gas is CO2 at STP (n=1.0005, $\theta_{max}$ = 1.7 degrees, covers 5 to 35 degrees, 2$\pi$ in azimuth. Active area 2.4 meters in diameter. Electron signal threshold is 15 MeV, charged pion threshold is 5 GeV. 99.9\% electron detection efficiency vs. pions. 15 feet in diameter, 6 feet long. Mirror thickness is 0.1 g/$cm^2$. Kaons have no signal, as they would need 16 GeV to generate a signal. Uses Winston cones to increase collection efficiency. 20 photoelectrons per electron in HTCC, 25\% quantum efficency. The PMTs have 14 dynodes, gain of about $10^7$. HTCC material budget 0.135 g/$cm^2$

        \subsubsection{Torus}
        Outbending allows for lower Q2 measurements, inbending allows for slighly higher Q2 measurements. 

            6 coil torus, 4k amps, 3.5 Tesla torodial field, supercritical LHe cooled. 14.2 Megajoules stored energy. 2 Henries of inductance. Field strongest at small angles, weakest at large angles. 
              Inbending vs out bending:
        I have been wondering about this as well. All I know is that inbending and outbending have different acceptances.
        So, I guess some channels prefers inbending while the others do outbending? I’m not sure though. FX claims outbending results have better quality for these days.

        \subsubsection{Drift Chambers}
            There are 3 layers of drift chambers, each with 6 sections. Each chamber has 2 superlayers of 6 layers by 112 wires, for a total of 24,192 wires. (Structure is 112 wires * 6 layers * 2 superlayers * 18 DC sections = 24,192 wires). Physical wire sectioning looks like:\\
            (IIIIII)-(IIIIII)---(IIIIII)-(IIIIII)---(IIIIII)-(IIIIII) x 6 sectors\\
            Where each "I" is a layer of 112 wires.\\
            Spatial resolution is 300 $\mu$ m, angular coverage 5-40 degrees. Momentum resolution $\Delta$p/p < 1\%, angular resolution is 1 mrad in theta, 1mrad/$\sin{\theta}$ for phi. The Drift Chambers are located 2, 3, and 4 meters from the gas mixture is 90/10 Argon/CO2. Time resolution = ?\\
            DC specifics: 30 micron diameter tungsten sense wires, 80 micron Cu-Be field wires, 140 micron Cu-Be guard wires. 20 g tension on sense, 62 g tension of field, 180 g on guard. Max sag calculated to be on order of 10 microns.

        \subsubsection{LTCC}
            6 sectors, perfluorobutane ($C_4F_10$) $\longrightarrow$ n = 1.0013 $\longrightarrow$ $\theta_{max}$ = 3 degrees. Electron threshold 9 MeV, pion threshold 2.7 GeV, Kaon threshold 9.4 GeV. Allows for good pion/kaon discrimination from 3.5 Gev to 9 GeV. \\
            Each section has 108 mirrors, 36 winston cones, and 36 PMTs. Mirror is aluminium with $MgF_2$ coating. Kevlar support structure. Perflourobutane is 100\% transparent above 220 nm light.

        \subsubsection{RICH}
            Provides PID in the range of 3-8 GeV, replacing one sector of LTCC (right middle sector). Pion/Kaon rejection factor > 500, Kaon/Proton rejection factor > 100. Covers 5 to 25 degrees in theta, uses aerogel (n=1.05 $\longrightarrow$ $\theta_{max}$ = 18 degrees). Pion threshold 460 MeV, Kaon threshold 1.6 GeV. Read out by 64 channel photomultipliers. $\beta_{min}$=0.95, $\gamma_{min}$ = 3.3
            
            What is angular resolution?
            
            Reminder of relevant equation:
            \begin{equation}
                \cos{\theta} = \frac{1}{\beta n} \longrightarrow \theta = \arccos{\frac{1}{\beta n}}
            \end{equation}
            
            \begin{equation}
                \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}} \longrightarrow \beta = 1-\frac{1}{1-\gamma^2} 
            \end{equation}

            The timing resolution minimums are for being close to the beam axis where particles are moving faster, and farther out from the beamline (larger theta) particles are moving slower so a less resolved time difference is acceptable.

            FTOF two panels:
Official answer from CLAS12 FTOF NIM paper:
"For tracks that pass through both arrays the combined time information (described in Ref. [10]) is used and results in a 20% improvement compared to using the hit information from panel-1b alone.”, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900220302102

I guess this is the right answer though:
1a is recycled one from CLAS while 1b is new one.
            
            
        \subsubsection{PCal and ECal}
            ECal from CLAs could only contain showers with E < 5 GeV. Above 5.5 GeV, couldn't resolve neutral pion gamma gamma angle, so needed PCAL. PCAL is 7 meters from target, ECAL is 7.5 M from target. EC segmentation 10 cm, PCAL finer segmentation. PCal 5.5 radiation lengths. 20.5 radiation lengths total. Both are sampling calorimeters, with PB and scintillator layers. The CLAS ECAL was resused and a new PCAL was installed in front of it. Primarily used for identification of electrons, photons, gamma gamma decays from pions, and neutrons. They are sampling calorimeters with six moduels. Each module has a triangular shape with 54 (15/15/24 - PCAL/ECALinner/ECALouter) layers of 1 cm htick scintillators segmented into 4.5/10 cm (PCAL/ECAL) wide strips and sandwiched between 2.2 mm thick lead sheets. The total thickness is about 20.5 radiation lengths. \\
            \indent Scintillator layers are grouped into three readout views with 5/5/8 PCAL/ECinner/ECouter, layers per view providing several cm resolution of energy clusters. Light from each scintillator readout group is routed to PMTs via flexible optical fibers.\\
            Overall perfomance:\\
            Energy resolution of 10\%, position resolution of 2 cm, time resolution of 500 ps. \\
            Are these the real statistics? Because they seem like BS.

                PCAL scinitllator was manufactured at the FNAL-NICADD Extrusion Line Facility. Polystyrene base was Dow STYRON 663 W, primary dopant is 2,5 -diphenyloxazole (PPO, 1\% by weight) - this is the organic scintillator, peaks at 385 nm:

                Cast plastic scintillator costs about \$50 per kg, while extruded scintillator is significantly lower in price - about \$10 per kg.
