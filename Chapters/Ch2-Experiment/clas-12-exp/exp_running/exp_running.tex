            CLAS12 runs with "open trigger", which means different sub-experiments can define their own triggering logic. There is a standard electron trigger, based off of hits in HTCC, ECal, and FTOF. 

        Only about 50\% of the electron triggers recorded with an inbending torus polarity are actually electrons. For outbending torus polarity, hte electron trigger purity is as high at 70\%.

    20 kHz Level 1 trigger rate, 1 GB/s.

   The CLAS12 detector is a large angle spectrometer that generally covers angles from 5 to 130 degrees, spanned by two main detector subsystems - the Forward Detector and the Central Detector.
