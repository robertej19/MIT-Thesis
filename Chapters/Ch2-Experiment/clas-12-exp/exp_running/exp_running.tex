            CLAS12 runs with "open trigger", which means different sub-experiments can define their own triggering logic. There is a standard electron trigger, based off of hits in HTCC, ECal, and FTOF. 

        Only about 50\% of the electron triggers recorded with an inbending torus polarity are actually electrons. For outbending torus polarity, hte electron trigger purity is as high at 70\%.
