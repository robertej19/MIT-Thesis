\subsection{Particle Identification}


For this analysis all final state particles should be detected.
After $\pi^0$ decay we are going to have 4 particles: electron, proton and two photons.
The particle identification methods are applied to select the exclusive event with at least one electron, proton and two photons. 


    \subsubsection{Electron}
    \subsubsection{Proton}
    \subsubsection{Photon}
    \subsubsection{Pion}
    
    Basic event builder cuts are utilized, then additional cuts are made that are common with the RGA Analysis note (\href{https://www.overleaf.com/project/5ea737720942930001ff5e9c}{overleaf link} and developed by Sangbaek Lee (sangbaek@mit.edu - \href{https://github.com/Sangbaek/analysis_code/tree/analysis/pid}{github code here}. For this analysis, both the central detector and forward detector are utilized for proton tracking. The forward tagger is also utilized for photon identification. 
    


\subsubsection{Neutral pion}
    In addition to individual particle PID procedures the cut on the mass of two photons is applied:
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item $0.07<M_{\gamma\gamma}<0.2$ GeV
    \end{itemize}
    The pion is more thoroughly constrained by the exclusivity cuts, described in the next section.

\subsection{Data Storage and Formatting}
    \subsubsection{Data Location and Availability}
    \subsubsection{File Formatting and Conversion}\label{sec:filtering}
        Mention that same transformations are used for rec events and filtering
