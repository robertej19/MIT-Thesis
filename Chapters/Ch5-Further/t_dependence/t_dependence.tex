We can calculate the t dependence of the differential cross section $d\sigma_U/dt$ by integrating the reduced cross sections over $\phi$ as in equation \ref{eq:tdep}

 \begin{equation}\label{eq:tdep}
    \frac{d\sigma_U}{dt} = \int \frac{d^2\sigma}{dtd\phi} d\phi
\end{equation}

In order to account for regions where the detectors used in CLAS6 and CLAS12 have zero acceptance, it is necessary to include a correction factor $\eta'$, defined in equation \ref{eq:eta} and calculated using Monte Carlo. 

 \begin{equation}\label{eq:eta}
    \eta' = \frac{\int_{\Omega*} \frac{d^2\sigma}{dtd\phi} }{\int_{\Omega} \frac{d^2\sigma}{dtd\phi}}
\end{equation}

However, at this point this correction factor has not yet been calculated. Instead, we can focus on kinematic bins where the coverage in $\phi$ is nearly 100\%, such that $\eta'$ would be small. In figure \ref{fig:tdep} we show the t dependent cross section, calculated only for bins where the coverage in $\phi$ was greater than 90\%, thus the error from not including the $\eta'$ correction factor is only approximately 10\%. We observe a good agreement in the b slope parameter, which describes the width of the transverse momentum distribution of the proton, between CLAS12 and the published CLAS6 data.
