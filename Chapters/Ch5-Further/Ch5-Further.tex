Notes on Omnifold from Anselm Vossen:
I find this reference paper - \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09107.pdf}{arxiv}.




Yes, that is the reference. You saw that I also posted a reference to the Hera analysis. I don’t think many others have used omnifold yet, since it is quite computationally intensive etc.
My understanding is that Ben Nachman developed this and there has been follow up work by his group (if you just put his name into inspire you’ll see). E.g. I saw presentations on how to present the data. Here is a talk by Ben at a Jet workshop in 2021: \href{https://indico.bnl.gov/event/10555/contributions/54721/attachments/37368/61570/H1Measurement_EICWorkshopSeptember2021.pdf}{this paper}
 Miguel Arratia, who is also in CLAS collaborated on the H1 results. You could ask him for practical advice,
