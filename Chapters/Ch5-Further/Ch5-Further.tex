Finally, at the end of the day, we are interested in learning about the underlying transverse quark distribution inside of
nucleons. A fellow graduate student in Richard Milner’s group, Yimin Wang, recently defended his thesis which included the
use of non-parameteric methods to extract the radius of the proton from various collider experiments. Similar methodology
can be employed to the finalized results of this and other DVπ0P experiments to estimate the parameters of the distribution
of valence quarks. Also, rosenbluth separation methods will be employed to extract parameters between this experiment and
lower energy runnings done in the past decade to further results in this space. Work is ongoing on this, and the other two areas
mentioned above, to extract meaningful data from this process, and better understand quark mechanics inside of nucleons.

Work is ongoing collaboration-wide to verify the absolute scale of the cross section measurement in reference to other reactions. Here we compare to CLAS6 result instead for cross check.
