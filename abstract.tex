Deeply virtual exclusive reactions provide unique channels to study both transverse and longitudinal properties of the nucleon simultaneously, allowing for a 3D image of nucleon substructure. This presentation will discuss work towards extracting an absolute cross section for one such exclusive process, deeply virtual neutral pion production, using 10.6 GeV electron scattering data off a proton target from the CLAS12 experiment in Jefferson Lab Hall B . This measurement is important as exclusive meson production has unique access to the chiral odd GPDs, and is also a background for other exclusive processes such as DVCS, making the determination of this cross section crucial for other exclusive analyses.
